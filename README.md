## `Flutter internationalization & switching locales manually in Real Time` 

Demonstrates basic translations using a `I18n` widget.
  
There are 3 widget files that need translations:
* main.dart
* my_screen.dart
* my_screen2.dart

This time we demonstrate how to use a single translations-file for all of them:
* my.i18n.dart

Note: The translations-files in this example to use to create one json file and use it across the application. Instead of maintaining each files for seperate screen.
